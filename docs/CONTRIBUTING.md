# Contributing

I would love your inputs and ideas! My goal is to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Github Rocks

Everything is hosted in Github, issue tracking, feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## This roject uses [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you don't have it yet, please install the pre-commit. More info at https://pre-commit.com/
3. After pre-commit is installed, add the hooks by running `pre-commit install`4.
4. Adhere to the commit message guidelines as this repository uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), more info at https://github.com/mathieudutour/github-tag-action#bumping
5. At the moment the repository don't have automated testing, therefore, test it manually that you changes are not breaking anything
6. Update the documentation accordingly
7. Issue the pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

The repository is already using some tools to help with that, make sure you are running the pre-commit to lint all files, detect new secrets, etc...

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `pre-commit run -a` for style unification

The code on this repository is intended to be used to share media content with various networks such as Torrent and Usenet while protecting your privacy through a VPN (ProtonVPN). The main idea is to provide access where Internet censors and content restriction apply. I totally discourage using this code for any piracy reasons.

The stack can be run in any Linux box.\
Besides Plex transcoding, all other apps and functions are super light and a basic Raspberry Pi is able to handle the load.

All the apps are pre-configured and integrated. Therefore, with a few clicks you can start adding Indexers to the configurations and tinkering to your liking.

**IMPORTANT:** I strongly recommend rotating all the API keys and changing all the passwords.

# Usage

## 1 - Create dotenv (.env) file
Copy from the example and generate a new .env file.
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```
**OR**

```shell
make create_config
```

## 2 - Check your parameters
It is necessary to set a few parameters to match your environment.
Check your user id and gid. To get this info, go to your shell and run:
```shell
id
```

The result should be something like;
```shell
uid=1000(my_user) gid=1000(my_user) groups=1000(my_user)
```

After that, check your timezone. For that, run:
```shell
cat /etc/timezone
```

The result should be something like;
```shell
America/Toronto
```

Save these values for later reference.

## 3 - Edit dotenv (.env) file
Edit the newly created .env file and change the `UID, GID, and TIMEZONE` parameters to the values you gathered from steps 1 and 2.

## 4 - Configure the ProtonVPN/WireGuard parameters
Now, edit the file `configs/protonvpn/.env` with the values from the ProtonVPN page.

- Log in to ProtonVPN and go to Downloads â†’ WireGuard configuration.
- Enter a name for the key, and select features to enable like NetShield and VPN Accelerator & click create.
- Generated config might look something like below;

```[Interface]
# Key for <name>
# VPN Accelerator = on
PrivateKey = KLjfIMiuxPskM4+DaSUDmL2uSIYKJ9Wap+CHvs0Lfkw=
Address = 10.2.0.2/32
DNS = 10.2.0.1

[Peer]
# NL-FREE#128
PublicKey = jbTC1lYeHxiz1LNSJHQMKDTq6sHgcWxkBwXvt7GWo1E=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = 91.229.23.180:51820
```

- Only thing needed from the above config is PrivateKey.
- See https://protonvpn.com/support/wireguard-configurations/ for more info.

With the values from the page, change the `WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY` and `PROTONVPN_SERVER`.

**IMPORTANT:** To use a server that is best for you, please check the details in the ProtonVPN Docker page; https://github.com/tprasadtp/protonvpn-docker#protonvpn_server

## 5 - Run the containers
Now that everything is set, please run the containers by using the command below;
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

**OR**

```shell
make start
```

## 6 - Rotate your keys
All the services are pre-configured, therefore they already have API keys set.

It is **strongly recommended rotating all of them** for the sake of security.

# Bandwith Control
By default, both downloaders, qBitTorrent and NzbGet, are configured to limit from 8AM to 11:59PM to;

- **Download Rate** - 1 Gbps
- **Upload Rate**   - 30 Mbps (only applicable to qBitTorrent)

Outside of these hours, no speed control applied.\
If desired, it is possible to change or disable the settings in these app's configs.

## Clean up and revert to original state

If you need to revert to the original code and also want to delete any files inside the `shared` and `media` folders, simply run;

**IMPORTANT:** This will **ERASE** every file on your media folder!

```shell
docker-compose down
make clean
```

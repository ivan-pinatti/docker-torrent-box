The code on this repository is intended to be used to share media content with various networks such as Torrent and Usenet while protecting your privacy through a VPN (ProtonVPN). The main idea is to provide access where Internet censors and content restriction apply. I totally discourage using this code for any piracy reasons.

The stack can be run in any Linux box.\
Besides Plex transcoding, all other apps and functions are super light and a basic Raspberry Pi is able to handle the load.

All the apps are pre-configured and integrated. Therefore, with a few clicks you can start adding Indexers to the configurations and tinkering to your liking.

**IMPORTANT:** I strongly recommend rotating all the API keys and changing all the passwords.

# Usage

## 1. Check your parameters

It is necessary to set a few parameters to match your environment.
Check your user id and gid. To get this info, go to your shell and run:

```shell
id
```

The result should be something like;

```shell
uid=1000(my_user) gid=1000(my_user) groups=1000(my_user)
```

After that, check your timezone. For that, run:

```shell
cat /etc/timezone
```

The result should be something like;

```shell
America/Toronto
```

Save these values for later reference.

## 2.Create dotenv (.env) file

Copy from the example and generate a new .env file.

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

## 3. Edit dotenv (.env) file

Edit the newly created .env file and change the `UID, GID, and TIMEZONE` parameters to the values you gathered from steps 1 and 2.

In addition, set the `DOMAIN` variable for the certificate generation and the reverse proxy configuration.

For now the only available VPN provider configured is ProtonVPN, therefore leave the `VPN_PROVIDER` as default.

It will look something like this;
```
# System Parameters
UID=1000
GID=1000
TIMEZONE=America/Toronto
UMASK=022
DOMAIN=media-library.nas.local
VPN_PROVIDER=protonvpn
```
### 3.1. Edit ProtonVPN dotenv (.env) file

Now, edit the file `configs/protonvpn/.env` with the values from the ProtonVPN page.

- Log in to ProtonVPN and go to Downloads â†’ WireGuard configuration.
- Enter a name for the key, and select features to enable like NetShield and VPN Accelerator & click create.
- Generated config might look something like below;

```[Interface]
# Key for <name>
# VPN Accelerator = on
PrivateKey = KLjfIMiuxPskM4+DaSUDmL2uSIYKJ9Wap+CHvs0Lfkw=
Address = 10.2.0.2/32
DNS = 10.2.0.1

[Peer]
# NL-FREE#128
PublicKey = jbTC1lYeHxiz1LNSJHQMKDTq6sHgcWxkBwXvt7GWo1E=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = 91.229.23.180:51820
```

- Only thing needed from the above config is PrivateKey.
- See https://protonvpn.com/support/wireguard-configurations/ for more info.

With the values from the page, change the `WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY` and `PROTONVPN_SERVER`.

**IMPORTANT:** To use a server that is best for you, please check the details in the ProtonVPN Docker page; https://github.com/tprasadtp/protonvpn-docker#protonvpn_server

After that your `configs/protonvpn/.env` file should look like this;

```
WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY=KLjfIMiuxPskM4+DaSUDmL2uSIYKJ9Wap+CHvs0Lfkw=
PROTONVPN_SERVER=nl-free-127.protonvpn.net
KILL_SWITCH=true
```

## 4. Generate the certificate

At this moment the stack only supports self-signed certificates.

Go back to the `.env` file and look for the section about the certificate if you want to change any parameter.
An example is like;

```
# Certificate details
CERT_COUNTRY=CS
CERT_STATE=Classified
CERT_CITY=Classified
CERT_ORGANIZATION=Classified
CERT_OU=Classified
CERT_FQDN=${DOMAIN} # it will use the previously declared DOMAIN variable
```

After you have configured the parameters in the `.env` file, you can generate a certificate by running the command;

```
make generate_certificate
```

This will create the `server.key`, `server.crt`, and `server.pfx` in the `/certs/` folder.

### 4.1. Use your own certificate

If you have your own certificate, just copy them to the `/certs` folder using the exact names.

Remember, the `server.key`, `server.crt`, and `server.pfx` have to match the `uid` and `gid`, and the permissions have to be `644` for the `.crt` and `600` for the `.key` and `.pfx`.

## 5. Enable / Disable Apps

In the same `.env` file, edit the Docker container profile to enabled/disabled for the apps in the stack.

The only **REQUIRED** app is the `VPN_PROVIDER` as the stack is tightly coupled to it.

It will look like this;
```
# Default Apps' Profiles (enabled/disabled)
CALIBRE_PROFILE=disabled
CALIBREWEB_PROFILE=disabled
FLARESOLVERR_PROFILE=enabled
JACKETT_PROFILE=disabled
LAZYLIBRARIAN_PROFILE=disabled
LIDARR_PROFILE=disabled
MYLAR_PROFILE=disabled
NGINX_PROFILE=enabled
NZBGET_PROFILE=enabled
NZBHYDRA2_PROFILE=enabled
PLEX_PROFILE=enabled
PROTONVPN_PROFILE=enabled
QBITTORRENT_PROFILE=enabled
RADARR_PROFILE=enabled
READARR_PROFILE=disabled
SONARR_PROFILE=enabled

# NOT Default Apps' Profiles (enabled/disabled)
PROWLARR_PROFILE=enabled
```

## 6. Run the containers

Now that everything is set, please run the containers by using the command below;

```shell
docker-compose --profile enabled up --detach
```

**OR**

```shell
make start
```

## 7. Rotate your keys

All the services are pre-configured, therefore they already have API keys set.

It is **strongly recommended rotating all of them** for the sake of security.

## 8. Shutting it down

Now that everything is working, if you need to bring it down to change parameters and make adjustments, please run the command below;

```shell
docker-compose --profile enabled stop
```

**OR**

```shell
make stop
```

## 9. Backup

Now that everything is **fully working**. Make sure you create a backup of your configurations and changes, in order to perform the backup operation, please run;

```shell
make backup
```

This command will generate a backup of all the config folders.
